Overview: This project was a group project consisting of a total of five members. In this project, we developed a Java application that has a user interface made with Java AWT and Swing. This application connects to a local database (MySQL) to retrieve, update, add, or delete data. The data in the database includes user data, such as usernames, passwords, ID numbers, and the amount of money stored in the user's account. This allows users to create and sign in to their personal accounts. The database also holds dummy stock data, such as prices, the total quantity, and the amount available for purchase. The application uses multiple threads to constantly adjust the prices of the stocks to simulate a real stock market. Finally, the database also stores information about the transactions for each purchase/sale for each user. Each user can view their entire, detailed transaction history.
